This is a console based DART project on Saylani Student Management System (SSMS).
It is a small effort to showcase my DART programming skills with a limited functionality of CRUD operations.
The system will use a text file as DB to save and retrieve data.
It has 3 users with functionalities according to the rights assigned.
Admin user can access all the CRUD activities. (user: admin, password: admin)
Teacher user can access every functionalities except the Delete operations. (user: teacher, password: teacher)
Student user can only read the data. (user: student, password: student)
